# Event and Volunteer Management System

## Description

This project is a simple Event and Volunteer Management System implemented in C++ with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Qt.

It also provides a visual calendar to plan tasks and events and save data to an Excel file for later use.

## Features
- **Create Events**: Add events with details such as name, date, location, and description.
- **Add Volunteers**: Add volunteers with their personal information such as name, email, and phone number.
- **Assign Tasks**: Assign tasks to volunteers with detailed descriptions and start/end dates.
- **Visual Planning**: Visualize tasks and events using a calendar to see the scheduled tasks on specific dates.
- **Excel Export**: Save event and volunteer data into an Excel file for reporting.
